<p>I've been thinking through how to document projects on this site. There's lots of things happening at once, and I don't think random posts with tags is a good framework for documenting what's happening while it's happening.</p>
<p>So I'll make a new type of project page in here, updates can get appended to it instead of being separate pages. They can show a time-log style view as projects go from concept to sketches, to prototypes and then builds. I think it's also flexible enough to cover lots of project types.</p>
<p>Now I just need to decide how it should look in here.</p>
