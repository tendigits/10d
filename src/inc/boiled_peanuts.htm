 <p>This recipe has a delightfully mild sourness from the vinegar, not very spicy. Keeps in the fridge for a week.</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Add 2 lb more or less of un-roasted peanuts in shell to crockpot or pot</li>
<li>Add 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>Add 1/2 cup kosher salt</li>
<li>Add 1 Tbs. red pepper flakes</li>
<li>Fill crockpot with water, or several inches over height of dry peanuts in pot</li>
<li>Crockpot on "high" or "low" if using stove, for 8 hours at least</li>
<li>Peanuts should open easily, and nuts should be very soft without any crunch.</li>
</ul>
