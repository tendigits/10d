	<p>Our neighborhood put on an Art Walk, where
	everyone was invited to display art in their yard,
	or do a performance. This is during the
	Covid-19 pandemic, so everyone was glad for a way
	to get out and have an experience in a way that left
	plenty of space for people to keep their distance.</p>
	<p>Our street is part of a small group of new modern
	townhomes. As we are all relatively new to these
	homes, and they are tightly built together, we've
	made a point to have good communication.</p>
	<p>We decided our street should try to participate in
	the larger neighborhood effort in a big way. I offered
	to create &quot;coloring book&quot; style posters that everyone
	could fill in and decorate however they like. We
	chose the theme of bird species that are found here
	in the neighborhood.</p>
	<p>I made about a dozen of these, here's how they looked
	prior to decoration:</p>

	 data-lowsrc="../assets/img/bird-posters-low.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="400" height="300">
	<p>And here's how they looked after decoration and hung outside
	on various balconies.</p>

	 data-lowsrc="../assets/img/bird-posters-decorated-low.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="400" height="300">
	<p>It was a very rewarding feeling to have started a project
	that the neighborhood felt inspired to be
	involved with.</p>
