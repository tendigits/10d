    <ol>
    <li>Mix the dough, rest, shape, refrigerate overnight</li>
    <li>Boil, drain, add toppings, bake</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Makes 10 bagels</p>
    <ul>
    <li>680 grams of high gluten flour</li>
    <li>2 tsp table salt</li>
    <li>3/4 tsp instant yeast</li>
    <li>1 Tbs diastatic malt powder</li>
    <li>4 Tbs malt syrup</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cup + 1 Tbs warm water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Dissolve the instant yeast in water, stir and let sit 5 mins to ensure activation.</li>
    <li>Blend flour, diastatic malt, and salt.</li>
    <li>Add water/yeast to flour mix and blend/knead for ~8 mins until the dough is smooth and stretchy.</li>
    <li>Roll into two logs, cover with wet towel and let rest for 20 mins.</li>
    <li>Cut into 10 equal parts, stretch around you fingers and roll into bagel shape.</li>
    <li>Put bagels on tray, cover with the towel and refrigerate overnight.</li>
    <li>Fill a wide pot with ~3 inches of water and malt syrup.</li>
    <li>Bring water to boil and also preheat oven with baking stone to 450Â°F.</li>
    <li>Boil the bagels in batches that fit the pot until they float or ~2 mins. Drain on a rack and add toppings if you like.</li>
    <li>Bake 12 mins to start, and leave in longer (but watch closely) for darker color. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Bonus tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Really beat up the dough when mixing, try different speeds</li>
        <li>Try not to handle the dough too much after it rests, keep the unshaped parts covered too</li>
        <li>Equal sized bagels are nice, you can use a scale to divide the weight of the dough as you cut</li>
        <li>Use a stone the size of your oven rack for a nice crust on the bottom (I prefer this and don't flip during the bake)</li>
        <li>Only boil what fits in the pot and stove, wait until the stove is free to start the next batch boiling and keep uncooked bagels in fridge until ready to go in the water.</li>
        <li>They are best eaten same day, slice extras and freeze as soon as they cool. They keep well frozen for several weeks.</li>
    </ul>
