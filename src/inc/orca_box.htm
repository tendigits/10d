<p>The concept here is to create a physical controller with knobs and buttons for "playing" <a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/orca">Orca</a>.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi computer</li>
<li>Pi-Sound hat to provide Midi Din out</li>
<li>Grand central connected as USB &quot;keyboard&quot; device</li>
<li>Circuit python code maps buttons and knobs to keypresses or series of keypresses</li>
<li>Small display</li>
<li>Housing to provide all-in-one unit</li>
<li>External keyboard/mouse also used</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patchbox OS</li>
<li>Orca, uxn version</li>
</ul>

<p>I've setup enough code to prove that a potentiometer knob can be mapped to the range of values that are most useful to Orca: 0-9 and A-Z.
There was some challenge in tuning code to get a natural response. Without doing that it can feel jumpy.</p>
<p>I'm in the breadboard prototyping phase now, but I've (for now) settled on using about 6 knobs and 15 buttons. The buttons can be mapped to generate a series
of keypresses that render useful patterns like trackers, scales, etc. The knobs can be mapped to specific variables which will be available
in fixed locations on the bottom row. A button could be mapped to generate the variable code too.</p>
<p>I don't yet have a great vision for the housing design. I'd like it to be well considered and nicely crafted.</p>
<p>I have dropped the idea of >15 buttons as I realized that augmenting a real keyboard and mouse is much better than trying to replicate it.
I've also dropped the idea of using the half globe, as the screen needs to be easily readable to be useful.</p>

<p>I mapped out an initial idea for button layout. This seems really un-optimized with 62 buttons, but that's actually how many GPIO the Grand Central has, so I suppose it's possible. I'll do some more thinking... I believe this is not the final layout.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure that Grand Central can act as a keyboard, but I believe with the <a href="https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/hid/en/latest/index.html">Adafruit HID Library</a> it can.</p>
<p>I'm also not sure how I'll do midi out. Ideally I can convert from USB from the Pi to a midi din port for the box, but I'm not sure yet how to accomplish that.</p>
