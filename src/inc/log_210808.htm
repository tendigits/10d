<h3>Garden</h3>
<p>Some sort of blight has taken over the plants on the roof. Possibly the faded leaves and unhappy plants are suffering from too much water - it's been raining heavily. It appears the basil and hot peppers will survive, but it was a small harvest for the tomatoes, and the bell peppers rotted out.</p> 
<h3>Shade frames</h3>
<p>Completed and useful! I'll be making a project page for these soon to document the work. It involved some very simple wood working and a small bit of 3D printing. We are reducing our A/C usage by cutting down the harsh afternoon sun, and also making our back porch space more enjoyable for meals and hanging out.</p>
<h3>Orca box</h3>
<p>The concept of this project continues to evolve. Currently I'm considering it a stand-alone device with screen, a series of buttons and a series of potentiometers (knobs). I've successfully proven the knobs can be used to adjust values in an Orca variable (0-9 a-z). Next up will be to make a proof of concept for a button that prints out multiple lines of code. If that works, then the buttons can render out various useful patterns like different scales, tracker lists, etc. I can hook up a lot of buttons, so I may use some for other utilities like establishing the knob variables.</p>
<h3>Eurorack case v2</h3>
<p>I'm ready to rebuild with two new vector rails, but I may expand to add two more and possibly an acrylic front panel. 3D modeling is in progress.</p>
