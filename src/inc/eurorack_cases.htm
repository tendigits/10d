<h2>Rack 1: 3U 104hp case</h2>
<p>Uses Zeus studio bus and a side mounted Dual-access (both from TipTop) for power. It involved making 3 parts: left/right brackets (3D printed) and a laser cut acrylic front panel. These parts, plus vector rails and threaded bars (from Pulp Logic) fit together to make the case.</p>

<h2>Skiff 1: 4U 48hp mostly 3D printed skiff</h2>
<p>Tried making a skiff that is sized to fit within my 3D printer's print bed. The design was basically a box with tracks for threaded bars to be inserted. I did a test print and then scrapped because PLA 3d printed walls felt terrible to hold and seems like a waste of material.</p>

<h2>Skiff 2: 4U 48hp skiff</h2>
<p>Taking a cue from Rack 1 and using the bracket and panel model, but for this small skiff size. Aiming to be as minimal as possible, and letting the vector rails create most of the structure.</p>s
