	<p>At some point soon I should sort out how to clean up the unused site folders on
	my little Raspberry Pi server, and configure a chron tab to auto-update the SSL certs.</p>
	<p>But for now, it's not automated, and by the time the certs expire, I only sort
	of vaugely remember what I did to update them.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>SSH into the server (how to do this is saved in your Pass store)</li>
	<li>Run certbot-auto</li>
	<li>Wait a looooong time for it to get started</li>
	<li>Follow the prompts</li>
	<li>Done!</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There's not really much to it, but since I only have to do this once every
	few months, it's nice to have a reminder of what to do.</p>
