	<p>Bluebirds are on the endangered species list, they have a lot of competition and dangers trying to survive in suburban landscapes. This project serves a few purposes:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Provide a safe nesting house for Bluebirds</li>
	<li>Educational value in being able to witness nest building, egg sitting, hatching and rearing processes</li>
	<li>Easy way to care for birds and intervening against any predators</li>
	</ul>
	 
	<p>Over the span of a couple years, I created 3 different versions of this project. How one makes something like this varies depending on the conditions of the site. In my case:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ideal location about 20 feet from my house</li>
		<li>Nearby wall of house had outdoor electrical outlet</li>
		<li>I wasn't interested in putting a hole in the house and trying to run ethernet to the house</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This means that running on battery/solar (and the challenges involved) wasn't a requirement, but using WIFI for connectivity was.</p>
