    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Add 2 lb more or less of un-roasted peanuts in shell to crockpot or pot</p>
    <p>Add 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</p>
    <p>Add 1/2 cup kosher salt</p>
    <p>Add 1 Tbs. red pepper flakes</p>
    <p>Fill crockpot with water, or several inches over height of dry peanuts in pot</p>
    <p>Crockpot on "high" or "low" if using stove, for 8 hours at least</p>
    <p>Peanuts should open easily, and nuts should be very soft without any crunch.</p>
    
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>This is a very simple and plain recipe without much spice, there are many variations out there. This one has a delightfully mild sourness from the vinegar. Keeps in the fridge for a week.
