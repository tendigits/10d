<h2>Rack 1: 3U 104hp case</h2>
<p>Uses Zeus studio bus and a side mounted Dual-access from Tiptop for power. It's 3 parts: left/right brackets (3D printed) and a laser cut acrylic front panel</p>

<h2>Skiff 1: 4U 48hp 3D printed skiff</h2>
<p>Scrapped because PLA 3d printed walls felt terrible to hold and seems like a waste of material</p>
