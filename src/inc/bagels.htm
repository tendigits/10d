<p>I started making these at home this year and was
    surprised how good the results were. The key seems to
    be about getting the right kind of flour and diastatic malt powder.</p>
    <h2>The flour</h2>
    <p>The recipe I'm referencing calls for &quot;High-gluten flour&quot; however
    I chose a product called &quot;Super Bagel Flour&quot; from Baker's Authority,
    which includes other ingredients like malted barley flour.</p>
    <h2>Diastatic malt powder</h2>
    <p>This is used in the dough, but I also make slurry of it to add to the
    boiling water.</p>
    <h2>The process</h2>
    <p>This process includes an overnight chill in the fridge, so it's in two parts:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Make the dough, rest it, shape it, put in fridge</li>
    <li>Boil in water, add toppings, bake</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <p>These are not required, you can always improvise, but I'm using:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Stand mixer for mixing/kneading dough</li>
    <li>Large &quot;pizza&quot; stone for oven</li>
    <li>Very large pot for boiling multiple bagels at a time</li>
    <li>Scale for weighing flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>This makes 1 dozen</p>
    <ul>
    <li>680 grams of high gluten flour</li>
    <li>2 tsp table salt</li>
    <li>3/4 tsp instant yeast</li>
    <li>1 Tbs Diastatic yeast powder</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cup + 1 Tbs warm water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Dissolve the malt and yeast in water, stir and let sit 5 mins to activate.</li>
    <li>Blend flour and salt</li>
    <li>Add water and blend/knead for 10 mins until the dough is smooth and stretchy</li>
    <li>Roll into two 2&quot; logs, cover and let rest for 20 mins</li>
    <li>Cut into 12 equal parts, stretch it around you fingers and roll into bagel shape. Search online videos for technique demonstrated by experts.</li>
    <li>Put bagels on tray, cover and refrigerate overnight.</li>
    <li>Mix 2 Tbs malt powder with 2 Tbs water to make a slurry</li>
    <li>Boil large pot of water, add the slurry to it, and also preheat oven to 460Â°F</li>
    <li>Boil the bagels in batches that fit the pot you're using until they float. Drain and add toppings if you like.</li>
    <li>Bake 15-18 mins, let cool for 30.</li>
    </ul>
