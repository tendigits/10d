    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>It's an easy recipe, but it's in two parts:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Mix the dough, rest, shape, refrigerate overnight</li>
    <li>Boil, drain, add toppings, bake</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Makes 10 bagels</p>
    <ul>
    <li>680 grams of high gluten flour</li>
    <li>2 tsp table salt</li>
    <li>3/4 tsp instant yeast</li>
    <li>1 Tbs diastatic malt yeast powder (plus more for boil)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cup + 1 Tbs warm water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Dissolve the yeast in water, stir and let sit 5 mins to ensure activation.</li>
    <li>Blend flour, malt, and salt.</li>
    <li>Add water and blend/knead for ~8 mins until the dough is smooth and stretchy.</li>
    <li>Roll into two 2&quot; logs, cover with wet towel and let rest for 20 mins.</li>
    <li>Cut into 10 equal parts, stretch around you fingers and roll into bagel shape.</li>
    <li>Put bagels on tray, cover with the towel and refrigerate overnight.</li>
    <li>Fill a wide pot with 3+ inches of water, add ~3 Tbs or more additional diastatic yeast as the water is filling up.</li>
    <li>Bring water to boil and also preheat oven with baking stone to 450Â°F.</li>
    <li>Boil the bagels in batches that fit the pot until they float or ~2 mins. Drain on a rack and add toppings if you like.</li>
    <li>Bake 12 mins, and leave in longer (but watch closely) for darker color. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Bonus tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Really beat up the dough when mixing, try different speeds</li>
        <li>Try not to handle the dough too much after it rests, keep the unshaped parts covered too</li>
        <li>Equal sized bagels are nice, you can use a scale to divide the weight of the dough as you cut</li>
        <li>Use a stone the size of your oven rack for a nice crust on the bottom (I prefer this and don't flip during the bake)</li>
    </ul>
