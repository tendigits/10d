<![CDATA[<h3>Family</h3>
<p>I'm so glad my parents live nearby, but unfortunately my dad's health has presented some challenges lately. It's given me new perspectives (gratitude for my own health, for example) as we try to help both him, and my care-taking mom.</p>
<h3>Garden</h3>
<p>The roof garden is flourishing. The tomato plants are over 5 feet tall with lots of fruit, the first of which are starting to ripen. I'm letting the jalape√±os grow a bit bigger before harvesting, the bell peppers are taking their time, but growth continues.</p> 
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>I suppose it's been almost two months eating plant based food. I've found a general groove, and so far it's not been too much trouble. I look forward to more experimentation with new dishes. I was gifted a few cookbooks that may help as well. I have not had significant weight gain or loss, but I also have not re-instated a consistent exercise program. Daily evening walks suffice in the meanwhile.</p>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>I tried creating a VM instead of using a different machine in hopes of better adapting to a Linux based workflow, but so far it's only presented new setup challenges. My desire to have a good and usable Linux based workstation continues.</p>

<h3>In Progress:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shade frames with a pulley system for back porch</li>
<li>Custom Eurorack case</li>
<li>Videos or posts to describe AE modules</li>
<li>Rig to photograph old negatives</li>
<li>Rig to photograph old scrapbooks</li>
<li>ORCA box</li>
<li>Picture frames that play sounds</li>
</ul>

<h3>Completed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Building a 3d printer from kit</li>
<li>Dog bed sewing project</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scrapped:</h3>
<ul>
<li>3D printed sculpture wall art (opted for art print)</li>
<li>Growing tomato from last year's seeds (preferred to try different variety)</li>
</ul>]]>

<![CDATA[<h3>Vegan</h3>
<p>It's been a few weeks since I started adjusting my diet to be plant based. There are processed vegan products in the markets that I can use as helpers, but I hope not to be dependent on them long term. The hardest part is sorting out how (since I do all the cooking) to meal plan with Mindy's food preferences in mind. She is already largely on a plant based diet, but she didn't expect this change, so it's an adjustment.</p>
<h3>Manjaro i3</h3>
<p>Another life adjustment, one that's been very slow to take hold, is trying to adapt Linux as the primary OS for non-work computing. This has been a challenge to accomplish, and I continue to reduce the barriers (e.g. quick key/mouse switching and monitor sharing). I think the next step will be to map out the various tasks I do day-to-day (process photos from a camera, update this site, etc) and log the programs I'm using to do them. I noticed that I'm not remembering the program names yet since most are entirely new and not yet frequently used.</p>
