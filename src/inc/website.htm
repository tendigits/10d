	<p>This website is built using the <a href="https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co">same C-based compiler</a> that is used by the 100 Rabbits website.</p>
	<p>The compiler is simple enough that I could understand how to tweak it for my preferences. It does a great job of providing wiki-building features (terms, auto-linking) with very minimal dependencies. I'm not using this for it's features though, more so for what it doesn't do, the fact that it gets out of your way, and is easily the fastest builder I've ever used. Currently the average build time is 0.3s.</p>
